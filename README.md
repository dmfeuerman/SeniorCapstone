## Iteration #1:
Option #1. To run the software you must download the package. Using intilij it will say certian packages are not installed if you run (npm install NameOfPackage) this the package name it will install. Then run (npm install --global expo-cli) and ( npm install --global yarn). Finally run (yarn start) this will give you a QR code. If you download Expo Go from the store on your phone and scan the QR code it will boot up the app. 


If that does not work there is a qr code that will scan you into expo go except I will have to boot up the server so if you email me when you are going on I can boot it up.  

## Itteration #2:
Download Expo Go and scan this image
